The following program showcases the simplification of a .PLY model. The simplified model is displayed alongside a model of the original quality for comparison purposes.

To run it, I used VSCode's live server extention.

However any IDE or service which can mimic this functionality would work as well. Simply open source.html in a browswer and view.

The program was built using the three.js framework.
