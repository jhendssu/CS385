This shadertoy, called Machine DNA, is interesting to me because of the level of complexity, both in the forms of the columns and the lighting/fog, achieved with what appears to be a fairly small shader (less than 100 lines). The visuals interest me as I have done some generative art in the past as a hobby via p5.js and processing, but never in a 3D setting and this catches my eye as an interesting project. Also, despite visiting shadertoy in the past, I had no idea that sound could be incorporated into the experience, and I still don't fully understand how they're using shaders to generate sounds like they are.
